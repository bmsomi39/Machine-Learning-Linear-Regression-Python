# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression Implementaion

Jupyter Notebook implementation of Linear Regression :

Load Diabetes data set
Using Scipy
Using Scikit-Learn
Using Numpy
Using Matplotlib

Step 1:
Import modules/datasets; load diabetes dataset

Step 2:
linear_model imported to calculate linear regression(lr)
Once dataset loaded select which features to use (which physiological variables) - >  in this example only one variable is chosen

Step 3:
Split data into training and testing data. Last 20 samples used for testing data.

Step 4:
Create lr object, train it(with training data), by using fit() function

Step 5:
mse[Mean Square Error]-related to correlation strength.
Calculated by error for each sample(numpy mean)

Step 6: 
Variance score- score() , passing test data as parameters

Step 7:
Scatter plot of test data as line plot graphed.

Step 8:
Figure should be shown
